I recently received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by [Prof. Jonghwa Shin](http://apmd.kaist.ac.kr). During my Ph.D., my research was on optimization algorithms and physics-informed deep learningsfor the inverse design of nanophotonic devices. Previously, I received a BS in materials sceicne engineering and computer science from KAIST. 

I also worked in Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), supervised by [Dr. Donghun Kim](http://donghunkim.com). 

When I'm out of the computer, I spend time on traveling, hiking, or reading.
